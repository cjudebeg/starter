PYTHON VERSION

Before starting virtual environment run:

pyenv install 3.10.12

and
 
pyenv local 3.10.12

Start virtual environment: 

source venv/bin/activate

If your prompt isn't configured to show the python version you are using, in VScode, Shift + CTRL + P shows a list of available Python interpreters.
If you're not using 3.10.12, find from pull-down list and use.

Alternately, if the version of Python you are using is not 3.10.12 but does not conflict with dependencies, all is well.
